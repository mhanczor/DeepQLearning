Using Deep Q-Learning to solve OpenAI Gym environments

This work was for a project for my 10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning course.

Here are implementations of a linear Q-Network and deep Q-Network with experience replay for solving OpenAI Gym's MountainCar and CartPole environments.

As an addition to this project I implemented a deep Q-Network for solving the more complex Atari SpaceInvaders environment. This used raw RGB image input with a dueling architecture.
